A Firefox extension that allows for one click copying and formatting for Google sheets of name, url, job title, and current company on LinkedIn for all non-pinned, open tabs of the current browser window. 

It's very specific to my own private current use case workflow and is barebones with no options or settings. 

However, it does exactly what I want it to do: For all non-pinned tabs of the given window, find and copy the afore mentioned text and format it in tab-delimited format for simple paste into a google sheet document. 

# Usage

Pin the extension after loading. Then click the button to copy.
