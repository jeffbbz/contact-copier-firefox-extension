This is a one click copier for name, url, and job title on LinkedIn. It's very specific to my own private job hunt workflow and is barebones with no options or settings. However, it does exactly what I want it to do: For all non-pinned tabs of the given window, find and copy the afore mentioned text and format it in tab-delimited format for simple paste into a google sheet document. As this was developed my my own private workflow, there is no error handling. The extension expects all tabs to be LinkedIn tabs and doesn't check or handle if they aren't. Also the Job title logic may break because LinkedIn's DOM is highly obfuscated.
